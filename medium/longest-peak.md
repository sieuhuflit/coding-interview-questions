# Longest Peak

{% hint style="info" %}
### Longest Peak

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of the longest peak in the array.

A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly increasing until they reach a tip (the highest value in the peak), at which point they become strictly decreasing. At least three integers are required to form a peak.

For example, the integers 1, 4, 10, 2 form a peak, but the integers 4, 0, 10 don't and neither do the integers 1, 2, 2, 0. Similarly, the integers 1, 2, 3 don't form a peak because there aren't any strictly decreasing integers after the 3.

#### Sample Input

```
array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]
```

#### Sample Output

```
6 // 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3
```
